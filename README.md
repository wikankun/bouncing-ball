# Bouncing Ball In A Rotating Hexagon Using Javascript

A physics-based simulation of a ball bouncing inside a rotating hexagon, built with pure HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. You can try it live [here](https://wikankun.github.io/bouncing-ball).

## Project Background

This project was created as an experiment with Claude 3.5 Sonnet's ability to generate a complete physics simulation. The entire code was generated in a single conversation, demonstrating the AI's capabilities in creating interactive web applications.

## Features

- Real-time physics simulation with:
  - Gravity
  - Friction
  - Elastic collisions
  - Multi-wall collision resolution
- Interactive controls:
  - Rotate hexagon clockwise/counter-clockwise
  - Stop rotation
  - Reset ball position
- Adjustable physics parameters:
  - Gravity strength
  - Surface friction
  - Bounce energy (elasticity)

## Try It Out

1. Visit the [live demo](https://wikankun.github.io/bouncing-ball-hexagon)
2. Use the control buttons to rotate the hexagon
3. Adjust the sliders to experiment with different physics parameters
4. Click "Reset Ball" to start over
